# Work Log - 2026-02-10

## 1. Initialization
- Read `/requirements.md` and identified stack and architecture constraints.
- Decided to create a Maven multi-module project with `rest` and `ui` modules.

## 2. Project scaffolding plan
- Add root `pom.xml` as aggregator and dependency management parent.
- Build `rest` as Spring Boot app with profiles, Liquibase, JWT/security starter baseline, OpenAPI starter, and initial domain/API.
- Build `ui` as Maven module that can host a React app scaffold and be managed in the same build graph.

## 3. REST module implementation
- Added Spring Boot REST service skeleton with:
  - Security + CORS baseline configuration
  - Document entity/repository/controller
  - YAML profile configuration for local/dev/uat/prod
  - Liquibase SQL changelog and initial tables (`users`, `documents`)

## 4. UI module implementation
- Added React + TypeScript + Vite starter files under `ui/`.
- Added `frontend-maven-plugin` in `ui/pom.xml` so UI lifecycle can run from Maven.

## 5. Documentation updates
- Rewrote `README.md` for new multi-module structure and run commands.
## 6. Validation
- Attempted backend tests with `mvn -pl rest test`; blocked by Maven Central access (HTTP 403) in this environment.
- Attempted UI screenshot capture via Playwright at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`; no running dev server, so screenshot was not generated.
